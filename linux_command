The basic command is tar, followed by four options:

x – instructs tar to extract the files from the zipped file
v – means verbose, or to list out the files it’s extracting
z – instructs tar to decompress the files – without this, you’d have a folder full of compressed files
f – tells tar the filename you want it to work on
To list the contents of a .tar file before you extract it, enter:

tar –tzf documents.tar.gz
To instruct tar to put the extracted unzipped files into a specific directory, enter:

tar –xvzf documents.tar.gz –C /home/user/destination
